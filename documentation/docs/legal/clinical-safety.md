## Clinical Safety

The RCPCH NHS Organisations does not have any role in the direct clinical management of patients, it is solely for providing services to RCPCH software. It does not therefore require a clinical safety case or a Clinical Safety Officer.

## Medical Device Registration

The RCPCH NHS Organisations does not have any role in the clinical management of patients, it is solely for providing services to RCPCH software. It is not a medical device and as such requires no medical device registration.
