# Scripts

This `s` directory contains convenience scripts to reduce typing, reduce the risk of errors, and improve consistency when working on the project.

More information on each script can be found in the project's documentation site.

Each script's function should also be documented within its source code. Some scripts use other scripts, so it is recommended to read the source code of any script you intend to use.
